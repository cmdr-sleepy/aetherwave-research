## Operation Quantum Lens
### A Collaborative Research Project by CMDR Pattern State & EC

Welcome to the collected research logs of our ongoing investigation into unusual Thargoid signal patterns. These logs document our journey from initial discovery through detailed quantum analysis, combining human intuition with Guardian-enhanced AI processing.

### Key Researchers

- **CMDR Pattern State**: Former Pilots Federation data analyst, specializing in Thargoid signal analysis
- **EC (Enhanced Cognition Unit #GRD-8756-PF)**: Guardian-tech enhanced AI researcher, quantum processing specialist

### Reading Order

The logs are presented chronologically, starting with the initial incident report and progressing through our deepening understanding of the signals. Each entry builds upon previous discoveries, painting a picture of what may be the most significant breakthrough in Thargoid communication attempts.
