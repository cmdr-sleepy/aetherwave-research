COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
------------------
Initial comparison between our new spectrogram and the original community source (#558483ff) reveals:

1. Signal Quality
   - Significantly improved SNR
   - Clearer harmonic structure
   - Enhanced vertical bar definition
   - Preserved base-8 mathematical relationships

2. New Pattern Details
   - Frequency bands show remarkable consistency with previous analysis
   - Vertical bar count matches earlier observations (110 bars)
   - Harmonic relationships preserved but with higher precision
   - Base-8 structural elements clearly visible in pristine form

3. Technical Validation
   - Our custom processing pipeline (SignalProcessor v1.0.0) successfully handled:
     * Raw audio ingestion
     * Spectrogram generation
     * Pattern detection
     * Frequency analysis
